# Protected-Component 🚫

Just a simple wrapper component that can wrap every protected component. 
So users can see them only under certain circumstances.

It only shows the principles of route protection. It's much complexer in real projects. 💁

This is build with `create-react-app`. In the root folder, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.🏌
